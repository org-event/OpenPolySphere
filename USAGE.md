## Audio Setup for Calls

For Google Meet, Zoom, or any call app:

1. Install [BlackHole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/) (both 2ch and 16ch)
2. In your call app, set **BlackHole 2ch** as microphone
3. In your call app, set **BlackHole 16ch** as speakers
4. Use **Google Chrome** for the call app — Safari has audio limitations

The translator automatically routes audio through BlackHole: your translated speech goes to the call, their speech comes back for translation.
